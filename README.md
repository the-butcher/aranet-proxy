# aranet-proxy

Connect your Aranet CO₂ monitor to your PC or Android mobile phone and display the current CO₂ value.

This project was inspired by the more general https://github.com/kasparsd/sensor-pilot/blob/master/package.json project, which was very helpful for being able to understand the Bluetooth API of the Aranet device. Same applies to https://pypi.org/project/pyaranet4/1.0.0b2/.

This is a first draft and could be extended to i.e. retrieve historic data for more sophisticated display.

A live version can be found at https://aranet.the-butchers.at/
